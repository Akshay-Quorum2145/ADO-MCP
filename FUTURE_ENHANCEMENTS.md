## Implementation Priority

When implementing these enhancements, consider the following priority order:

**High Priority:**
1. Add comments to work items
2. Search/query work items
3. Update additional work item fields (description, assigned to, priority)
4. Create new work items

**Medium Priority:**
5. Work item relationships (linking)
6. Pull request operations
7. List work items with filters
8. Work item history

**Low Priority:**
9. Analytics and reporting
10. Pipeline and build operations
11. Bulk operations
12. Advanced caching and performance optimizations

**Nice to Have:**
13. Templates
14. Webhooks
15. Offline mode

## Contributing

If you'd like to implement any of these features, please:

1. Open an issue to discuss the feature
2. Reference this document in your PR
3. Update this checklist when the feature is implemented
4. Add documentation for the new feature in README.md

## Notes

- Some features may require additional Azure DevOps API permissions
- OAuth implementation would require Azure AD app registration
- Performance optimizations should be data-driven (profile first)
- Consider backward compatibility when adding new features
